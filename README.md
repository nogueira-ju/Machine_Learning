# Machine_Learning

This respository is intended to provide examples of multiple Machine Learning techniques applications to various Chemical Engineering regression and classification problems.
The jupyter notebooks are fairly comented in portuguese, to help understanding the code's goals.

Each folder of the repository contains one or more jupyter notebooks that train and test a certain model using a specific Machine Learning algorithm.
Also, text files with corresponding applied data are available.
